This choice stem from the fact that the implementation we used for $MKL$ gives us
back a set of weights, one for each of the input kernel matrices; these weights,
multiplied by their related matrix which then get summed together give us the
best linear combination of the input kernels.
While a weight is not to be taken as an assessment of the goodness of a single
kernel matrix (since they are optimal as a combination), a very low weight can
indeed be a sure sign that the related matrix has given a very poor contribution
to the classification task.
