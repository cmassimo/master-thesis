    abstract="Haussler's convolution kernel provides an effective framework for engineering positive semidefinite kernels, and has a wide range of applications. On the other hand, the mapping kernel that we introduce in this paper is its natural generalization, and will enlarge the range of application significantly. Our main theorem with respect to positive semidefiniteness of the mapping kernel (1) implies Haussler's theorem as a corollary, (2) exhibits an easy-to-check necessary and sufficient condition for mapping kernels to be positive semidefinite, and (3) formalizes the mapping kernel so that significant flexibility is provided in engineering new kernels. As an evidence of the effectiveness of our results, we present a framework to engineer tree kernels. The tree is a data structure widely used in many applications, and tree kernels provide an effective method to analyze tree-type data. Thus, not only is the framework important as an example but also as a practical research tool. The description of the framework accompanies a survey of the tree kernels in the literature, where we see that 18 out of the 19 surveyed tree kernels of different types are instances of the mapping kernel, and examples of novel interesting tree kernels.",

    abstract ={We have developed an effective and optimally safe microculture method for rapid and convenient assay of the in vitro cytopathic effects of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) on human lymphoblastoid or other suitable host cells. The assay procedure is applicable to the evaluation of drug effects on in vitro infections Induced directly in cultured host cells by cell-free HIV-1 or by coculture with H9 cells chronically infected with HIV-1. The assay uses a newly developed tetrazolium reagent that is metabolically reduced by viable cells to yield a soluble, colored formazan product measurable by conventional colorimetric techniques. This simple microassay minimizes the number of plate manipulations typically required with other assay methods and, coupled with computerized data collection and analysis, facilitates large-scale screening of agents for potential antiviral activity. To support and enhance the discovery of new anti-HIV-1 agents, the National Cancer Institute is offering investigators worldwide the opportunity to submit new candidate agents for anti-HIV-1 screening with this method.
